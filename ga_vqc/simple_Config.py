            Defines the configuration parameters for the GA.

            GA Config Params:
                - backend_type: Type of backend to use for the GA, so far only high is implemented.
                                    In the future this will change how low-level the circuits are
                - vqc: Your function that runs the vqc training. Think like the main function for your vqc.
                - vqc_config: Dictionary that defines the configuration parameters for your vqc.
                - ga_output_path: filepath for the output of the GA.
                - max_concurrent: Used for parallelization, defines the number of concurrent circuits to 
                                    use multiprocessing on.
                - n_qubits: The number of qubits the GA optimize the ansatz with. This is static, and is 
                                determined by the dimensionality of your input data.
                - n_init_moments: The number of moments the GA will initialize for all circuits it tries.
                - max_moments: The number of maximum moments for all circuits. This calues changes as the GA
                                    populates more of the circuits. If a threshold # of circuits are at this 
                                    value (usually 80%), max_moments will increase. This is done to limit 
                                    bias placed on the GA.
                - add_moment_prob: The probability to add a moment to a circuit.
                - genepool: The Genepool, which encodes the allowed gates and their respective probabilities.
                - pop_size: Total number of circuits in the population at every optimization step.
                - init_pop_size: The number of circuits used for the initial string-distance randomization,
                                    which is done to maximize initial diversity.
                - n_new_individuals: Number of completely new circuits to generate every round. Can be 0.
                - n_winners: Number of population that are allowed to mate for the next round.
                - n_mutations: Number of point (individual gate) mutations to perform on the children 
                                circuits.
                - n_steps_patience: Number of optimization steps to wait with no improvement before ending
                                        the GA.
                - rng_seed: Seed for random operations, allows reproducibility.
